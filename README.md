Jint.DebugAdapter
=================
(Eventually) an implementation of the DebugAdapter protocol (used by e.g. Visual Studio Code) for Jint debugging.

Currently a hot mess. Not ready for production use (also uses functionality not yet merged into Jint).

* __Jither.DebugAdapter__ is a general purpose implementation of the DebugAdapter protocol.
* __Jint.DebugAdapter__ implements the DebugAdapter for Jint.
* __Jint.DebugAdapterExample__ is a small console app serving as an example (and testing ground).
* __VSCodeExtension__ contains a minial extension to interface VS Code with the debug adapter.
